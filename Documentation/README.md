# Leeds and Bradford

This route covers many of the busiest routes in West Yorkshire, including the large station of Leeds, and the two stations in Bradford. Also included are branches to Horsforth, Ilkley, Keighley and Dewsbury.

## Simulation

The included timetable is a real Monday timetable, which runs from 06:00 until about 11:00, though the end time for different services differs considerably after 09:00, so this may be better considered the end time.

Also included is a pre-start session with some additional "blue" automatic routes, this may make the operation slightly easier.

### Operating Tips
- Pay close attention to services approaching Leeds from the West, as some services will need to terminate, and some continue through towards York and Hull.
- Some services do not spend much time at Leeds before turning and leaving, so avoid setting departure routes too early for other services.
- There are two LNER services that leave Neville Hill T.M.D. Westbound, after which, the route across could be made automatic.

## Development

This route is open for further development on the ROS GitHub Organisation. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/Railway-Op-Sim/GB-LeedsAndBradford).

The timetable for this route was created using json2ttb, if you would like to make changes to the existing timetable, you may need to download it from the ROS website, or from the json2ttb GitHub repository.
